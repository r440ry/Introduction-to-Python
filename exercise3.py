# Test basic else statement, part 2

x = 10
y = 20

# Swap the x and y values in the conditional if statement
if x > y:
    print('x is greater than y')
else:
    print('x is less than or equal to y')
    
# In this example the if statement evaluates to False and is ignored
# So only the else code block (clause) executes with it's print statement
