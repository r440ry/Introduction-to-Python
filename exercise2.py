# Test basic if statement, part 1

x = 10
y = 20

if x < y:
    print('x is less than y')
else:
    print('x is greater than or equal to y')
    
# In this example the if statement evaluates to True
# Only the if code executes
# The else code block (clause) is ignored

#We could also do the following:

# x = 10
# y = 20
# 
# if x < y:
#     print(str(x) + ' is less than ' + str(y))
# else:
#     print('x is greater than or equal to y')
